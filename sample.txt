You can fit everything you know
In a bottle for you to show
Pick your brain apart and put it in
And build it again with needles and pins
Everything you have earned is a ship
With blue waves crashing into it
But nothing can touch your happy thoughts anymore
With your glass ceiling, walls, and floor

Sailing on a ship in a bottle
Anchor all your thoughts to the bottom
Pulling ropes and pulling your head back
To see what is breaking the foremast
You set sail alone, there is no crew
No one on the deck who can help you
This is all your own battle to win
This is your ship and you are the captain

Oh, captain, let's make a deal
Where we both say the things that we both really feel
I feel scared and I'm starting to sink
And I only sink deeper the deeper I think

Oh, captain
Oh, captain, deal
Oh, captain, deal
Oh, captain, deal
Oh, woah

There are red spots under your eyes
From when you cry into the sky
Ocean waters rising above your neck, mmm
You feel the glass start to crack

Sailing on a ship in a bottle
Water's leaking through holes in the bottom
Flying flags of ships that have long since
Sat at the floor of the sea, but in defense
You set sail alone, there is no crew
No one on the deck who can help you
This is all your own battle to win
This is your ship and you are the captain

Oh, captain, let's make a deal
Where we both say the things that we both really feel
I feel scared and I'm starting to sink
And I only sink deeper the deeper I think
Oh, captain, make up your mind
Before the salt burns your eyes and you run out of time
'Cause you're popping the cork, you get lost in your brain
And you lose touch with all the things that made you feel sane

Oh, captain
Oh, captain, deal
Oh, captain, deal
Oh, captain, deal
Oh, woah

Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, woah
Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, woah

Oh, captain, let's make a deal
Where we both say the things that we both really feel
I feel scared and I'm starting to sink
And I only sink deeper the deeper I think
Oh, captain, make up your mind
Before the salt burns your eyes and you run out of time
'Cause you're popping the cork, you get lost in your brain
And you lose touch with all the things that made you feel sane

Oh, captain
Oh, captain, deal
Oh, captain, deal
Oh, captain, deal
Oh, woah

Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, woah
